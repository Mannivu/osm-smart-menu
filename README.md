### Translations
Add a file called `messages.json` in the folder `addon/_locales/<LANGUAGE_CODE>/`.
See [Chrome's documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/i18n#overview-locales) for more details.

Some websites' names should be left untranslated, preserving the original name.

After that's done, you can also translate `addon/_locales/en/long_description.html`. This file's content is used in extension websites.
